library("janitor")
```

```{r}
malaria <- read.csv("data/malaria.csv") %>% clean_names()
```

```{r}
malaria_long <- malaria %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("malaria_rdt"),
               names_to = "age_class",
               values_to = "cases") %>% 
  select(data_date,submitted_date,location_name,district,age_class, cases)
```

4. which district had the highest total number of cases on july 30, 2020
```{r}
malaria_long %>% 
  filter(data_date =="2020-07-30") %>% 
  group_by(district) %>% 
  summarize(tot_cases = sum(cases, na.rm=T))
```
