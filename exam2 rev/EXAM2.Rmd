## Midterm 1 Review
Let's briefly review the questions from midterm 1 so you can get an idea of how I was thinking about the problems. Remember, there is more than one way to get at these answers, so don't worry if yours looks different than mine!  

## Penguins
We rushed through the second part of lab 7 last week, so let's do a quick review of some key functions. As you know, summarize() and group_by() are powerful tools that we can use to produce clean summaries of data. Especially when used together, we can quickly group variables of interest and save time. Let's do some practice with the [palmerpenguins(https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html) data to refresh our memory.

```{r}
?penguins
```

Recall that group_by() and summarize() work great together. Let's say we were interested in how body mass varied by island. It is reasonable to assume that the islands are different, so maybe the penguins are as well.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(island) %>% #how to group a group of value by island / location
  summarize(mean_body_mass_g=mean(body_mass_g, na.rm=T)) # remember to remove those NA's!, and you are creating a new column when using summarize
```

What if we are interested in the number of observations (penguins) by species and island?
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(island, species) %>% 
  summarize(n_penguins=n(), .groups = 'keep') #same result if there is no .groups = 'keep'
```

Recall that that `count()` works like a combination of `group_by()` and `summarize()` but just shows the number of observations.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  count(island, species)
```

`tabyl()` will also produce counts, but the output is different. It is just a matter of personal preference.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  tabyl(island, species)
```

## Practice
1. Produce a summary of the mean for bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, and body_mass_g within Adelie penguins only. Be sure to provide the number of samples.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species=="Adelie") %>% #only Adelie species
  select(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g) %>% 
  summarize(mean_bill_length_mm=mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm=T),
            mean_bill_depth_mm=mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm=T),
            mean_flipper_length_mm=mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm=T),
            mean_body_mass_g=mean(body_mass_g, na.rm=T),
            n_samples=n())
```

2. How does the mean of `bill_length_mm` compare between penguin species?
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% # when comparing something, remember to group by species
  summarize(mean_bill_length_mm=mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm=T))
```


3. For some penguins, their sex is listed as NA. Where do these penguins occur?
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  count(sex, island)
```

## `across()`
How do we use `filter()` and `select()` across multiple variables? There is a function in dplyr called `across()` which is designed to help make this efficient.  

Here we are summarizing the mean of all variables that contain "mm".
```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarize(across(contains("mm"), mean, na.rm=T)) #when trynna use across / contain, must use summarize function
#in this case, these are the summary of mean for both sex
```

`group_by` also works.
```{r}
penguins %>%
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(across(contains("mm"), mean, na.rm=T))
```

Here we summarize across all variables.
```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarise_all(n_distinct) #n distinct used to count the counts in each variable
```

Operators can also work, here I am summarizing `n_distinct()` across all variables except `species`, `island`, and `sex`.
```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarize(across(!c(species, island, sex, year), 
                   mean, na.rm=T))
```

All variables that include "bill"...all of the other dplyr operators also work.
```{r}
penguins %>%
  summarise(across(starts_with("bill"), n_distinct)) #if you want mean -> can also replace n distinct with mean, etc
```

## Practice
1. Produce separate summaries of the mean and standard deviation for bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, and flipper_length_mm for each penguin species. Be sure to provide the number of samples.  
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(across(c(contains("mm"), body_mass_g), mean, na.rm=T ), #you use c because there are more than 1 variable in the across function
            n_samples=n())
```

## Review
When working with "wild" data, dealing with NA's is a fundamental part of the data cleaning process. Data scientists spend most of their time cleaning and transforming data- including managing NA's. There isn't a single approach that will always work so you need to be careful about using replacement strategies across an entire data set. And, as the data sets become larger NA's can become trickier to deal with.  

For the following, we will use life history data for mammals. The [data](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E084/093/) are from:  
**S. K. Morgan Ernest. 2003. Life history characteristics of placental non-volant mammals. Ecology 84:3402.**  

## Load the mammals life history data and clean the names  
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
life_history <- read_csv("data/mammal_lifehistories_v3.csv") %>% clean_names()
```


This will give you a quick summary of the number of NA's in each variable. Notice that, at least for now, it doesn't look like there are any NA's. But, given the size of the data this is unlikely.
```{r}
life_history %>% map_df(~ sum(is.na(.)))
```

## Practice
1. Can we use a single approach to deal with NA's in this data set? Given what you learned in the previous lab, how would you manage the NA values?
```{r}
life_history_no_nas <- 
  read_csv(file = "data/mammal_lifehistories_v3.csv", na = c("NA", " ", ".", "-999")) %>% clean_names() # notice that I am creating a new object/ dataframe that doesn't have any NA's
```

Recheck
```{r}
life_history_no_nas %>% map_df(~ sum(is.na(.))) # we fixed most of the problems
```

## `naniar`
[naniar](https://naniar.njtierney.com/articles/replace-with-na.html#:~:text=replace_with_na_all()%20Replaces%20NA%20for,numeric%2C%20is.) is a package that is built to manage NA's. Many of the functions it performs can also be performed using tidyverse functions, but it does provide some interesting alternatives.  

`miss_var_summary` provides a summary of NA's across the data frame.
```{r}
miss_var_summary(life_history_no_nas)
```

Notice that `max_life` has no NA's. Does that make sense in the biological context of this data? Why would an animal have 0 life span?
```{r}
hist(life_history_no_nas$max_life) #we found another way that NA's are represented
```

Let's use `mutate()` and use `na_if()` to replace 0's with NA's in `max_life`. This chunk allows us to address problems in a single variable.
```{r}
life_history_no_nas <- life_history_no_nas %>% 
  mutate(max_life=na_if(max_life, 0))
```

We can also use `miss_var_summary` with `group_by()`. This helps us better evaluate where NA's are in the data.
```{r}
life_history_no_nas %>%
  group_by(order) %>%
  miss_var_summary(order=T)
```

`naniar` also has a nice replace functions which will allow you to precisely control which values you want replaced with NA's in each variable. This is a nice alternative to `mutate()` and `na_if()`.  
```{r}
life_history %>% #going back to the original data
  replace_with_na(replace = list(newborn = "not measured", 
                                 weaning= -999, 
                                 wean_mass= -999, 
                                 afr= -999, 
                                 max_life= 0, 
                                 litter_size= -999, 
                                 gestation= -999, 
                                 mass= -999)) %>% 
miss_var_summary()
```

You can also use naniar to replace a specific value (like -999) with NA across the entire data set.  
```{r}
life_history %>% #going back to the original data
  replace_with_na_all(condition = ~.x == -999)%>% #any 999 will be na
miss_var_summary()
```

Finally, naniar has some built-in examples of common values or character strings used to represent NA's. The chunk below will use these built-in parameters to replace NA's across the entire data set.
```{r}
common_na_strings
```

```{r}
common_na_numbers
```

```{r}
life_history %>% #going back to the original data
  replace_with_na_all(condition = ~.x %in% c(common_na_strings, common_na_numbers)) %>% 
  mutate(newborn=na_if(newborn, "not measured"))
```

1. Import the data and do a little exploration. Be sure to clean the names if necessary.
```{r}
cites <- read_csv("data/cites.csv") %>% clean_names()
```

2. Use `naniar` to summarize the NA's in each variable.
```{r}
miss_var_summary(cites) #use this instead 
```

3. Try using `group_by()` with `naniar`. Look specifically at `class` and `exporter_reported_quantity`. For which taxonomic classes do we have the highest number of missing export data? / aka which class has the most na
```{r}
cites %>%
  select(class, exporter_reported_quantity) %>% 
  group_by(class) %>%
  miss_var_summary() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_miss)) #n miss is basically the n
```

## Dealing with NA's in advance- nuclear option
If you are sure that you know how NA's are treated in the data, then you can deal with them in advance using `na()` as part of the `readr` package. Notice that you still need to deal with some variables seperately. For example, you don't want to replace all 0's with NA, just the `max_life` variable.  
```{r}
read_csv(file = "data/mammal_lifehistories_v3.csv", na = c("NA", " ", ".", "-999", "not measured")) %>% clean_names()
```


LAB 9

## Tidy data
Most "wild" data are organized incorrectly for work in R and, as you might expect, the tools used to transform data are a core part of the tidyverse. I will attempt to summarize the most important points below, but you should read [chapter 12 of the data science text](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) for a more thorough explanation.  

`Tidy` data follows three conventions:   
(1) each variable has its own column  
(2) each observation has its own row  
(3) each value has its own cell  

This is summarized in the image below. The package used to tidy data is called **tidyr** and is a core part of the tidyverse.  
![*Tidy Data.*](tidy-1.png)

## `pivot_longer()`  
Scientists frequently use spreadsheets that are organized to make data entry efficient. This is often referred to as **wide format**. Unfortunately, the wide format creates a problem because column names may actually represent values of a variable. The command `pivot_longer()` shifts data from wide to long format.   

Rules:  
+ `pivot_longer`(cols, names_to, values_to)
+ `cols` - Columns to pivot to longer format
+ `names_to` - Name of the new column; it will contain the column names of gathered columns as values
+ `values_to` - Name of the new column; it will contain the data stored in the values of gathered columns

## Example 1: column names are data
The following data show results from a drug trial with four treatments on six patients. The values represent resting heart rate.  
```{r}
heartrate <- read_csv("data/heartrate.csv")
heartrate
```

Let's assess whether or not these data are tidy.  
(1) each variable has its own column?  
 
(2) each observation has its own row?  

(3) each value has its own cell?  
  
To fix this problem, we need to reshape the table to long format while keeping track of column names and values. We do this using `pivot_longer()`. Notice that the dimensions of the data frame change.  
```{r}
heartrate %>% 
  pivot_longer(-patient, #patient will not move
               names_to = "drug", #make a new column called "drug"
               values_to="heartrate" #values moved to a new column called "heartrate"
               )
```

## Practice
1. Import the file `relig_income.csv` and store it as a new object `relig_income`.  
```{r}
relig_income <- read_csv("data/relig_income.csv")
relig_income
```

2. Why are these data untidy?  

3. Use `pivot_longer()` to make the data tidy.  
```{r}
relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(-religion, #dont change religion
               names_to = "income",
               values_to = "total"
  )
```

## Example 2: some column names are data
Some (but not all) of the column names are data. We also have NA's.
```{r}
billboard <- read_csv("data/billboard.csv")
billboard
```

Solution 1: specify a range of columns that you want to pivot.
```{r}
billboard2 <- 
  billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(wk1:wk76, # a range of columns
               names_to = "week",
               values_to = "rank", 
               values_drop_na = TRUE #this will drop the NA's
               )
billboard2
```

Solution 2: OR, specify columns that you want to stay fixed.
```{r}
billboard3 <- 
  billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(-c(artist, track, date.entered), #specific columns to stay fixed
               names_to = "week",
               values_to = "rank",
               values_drop_na = TRUE
               )
billboard3
```

Solution 3: identify columns by a prefix, remove the prefix and all NA's.
```{r}
billboard %>% 
   pivot_longer(
   cols = starts_with("wk"), #columns that start with "wk"
   names_to = "week",
   names_prefix = "wk",
   values_to = "rank",
   values_drop_na = TRUE)
```

## Practice  
1. Import `plant_data.csv` as a new object `plant_data`.  
```{r}
plant_data <- read_csv("data/plant_data.csv")
plant_data
```

3. Use `pivot_longer()` to make the data tidy. Focus the data only on genotype, water_sched_prog, and greenhouse.  
```{r}
plant_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(-c(genotype, water_sched_prog, greenhouse),
               names_to = "v1",
               values_to = "v2",
               values_drop_na = T
               )
```

## Example 3: more than one variable in a column name
In this case, there are two observations in each column name.
```{r}
qpcr_untidy <- read_csv("data/qpcr_untidy.csv")
qpcr_untidy
```

`names_sep` helps pull these apart, but we still have "exp" and "rep" to deal with.  
```{r}
qpcr_untidy %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    exp1_rep1:exp3_rep3,
    names_to= c("experiment", "replicate"),
    names_sep="_",
    values_to="mRNA_expression"
  )
```

## `pivot_longer()`
Recall that we use `pivot_longer()` when our column names actually represent variables. A classic example would be that the column names represent observations of a variable.
```{r}
datasets::USPersonalExpenditure
?USPersonalExpenditure
```

Here we add a new column of expenditure types, which are stored as rownames above, with `mutate()`. The `USPersonalExpenditures` data also needs to be converted to a data frame before we can use the tidyverse functions, because it comes as a matrix.
```{r}
expenditures <- USPersonalExpenditure %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% #this transforms the matrix into a data frame
  mutate(expenditure = rownames(USPersonalExpenditure))
expenditures
```

## Practice
1. Are these data tidy? Please use `pivot_longer()` to tidy the data.
```{r}
expenditures %>% 
  pivot_longer(-expenditure, #not moving ependiture
               names_to = "year", # new variable year
               values_to = "bn_dollars") #moving values into bn_dollars
```

2. Restrict the data to private education only. Sort in ascending order.
```{r}
expenditures %>% 
  pivot_longer(-expenditure,
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "bn_dollars") %>% 
  filter(expenditure=="Private Education") #filter go after pivot
```

## `separate()`
In this new heart rate example, we have the sex of each patient included with their name. Are these data tidy? No, there is more than one value per cell in the patient column and the columns a, b, c, d once again represent values.
```{r}
heartrate2 <- read_csv("data/heartrate2.csv")
heartrate2
```

We need to start by separating the patient names from their sexes. `separate()` needs to know which column you want to split, the names of the new columns, and what to look for in terms of breaks in the data.
```{r}
heartrate2 %>% 
  separate(patient, into= c("patient", "sex"), sep = "_") #combine 2 column into 1
```

## Practice
1. Re-examine `heartrate2`. Use `separate()` for the sexes, `pivot_longer()` to tidy, and `arrange()` to organize by patient and drug. Store this as a new object `heartrate3`.  
```{r}
heartrate3 <- heartrate2 %>% 
  separate(patient, into=c("patient", "sex"), sep="_") %>% 
  pivot_longer(-c(patient, sex),
               names_to = "drug",
               values_to = "heartrate")
heartrate3
```

2. `unite()` is the opposite of separate(). Its syntax is straightforward. You only need to give a new column name and then list the columns to combine with a separation character.  Give it a try below by recombining patient and sex from `heartrate3`.  
```{r}
heartrate3 %>% 
  unite(patient_sex, "patient", "sex", sep=" ")
```

## `pivot_wider()`
The opposite of `pivot_longer()`. You use `pivot_wider()` when you have an observation scattered across multiple rows. In the example below, `cases` and `population` represent variable names not observations.  

Rules:  
+ `pivot_wider`(names_from, values_from)  
+ `names_from` - Values in the `names_from` column will become new column names  
+ `values_from` - Cell values will be taken from the `values_from` column  

```{r}
tb_data <- read_csv("data/tb_data.csv")
tb_data
```

```{r}
tb_data %>% 
  filter(key=="population")
```



When using `pivot_wider()` we use `names_from` to identify the variables (new column names) and `values_from` to identify the values associated with the new columns.
```{r}
tb_data %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "key", #the observations under key will become new columns
              values_from = "value") #the values under value will be moved to the new columns
```

## Practice
1. Load the `gene_exp.csv` data as a new object `gene_exp`. Are these data tidy? Use `pivot_wider()` to tidy the data.
```{r}
gene_exp <- read_csv("data/gene_exp.csv")
gene_exp
```

```{r}
gene_exp %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "type",
              values_from = "L4_values")
```

## Practice
For the last practice example, I will use data from the awesome [R Ladies Sydney](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/02-cleanitup-5/) blog. This data set is compiled by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage contains the enterococci counts in water samples obtained from Sydney beaches as part of the Beachwatch Water Quality Program! The data set we’ll be working with is current as of October 13th 2018.  

1. Load the beachbugs data and have a look.
```{r}
beachbugs <- read_csv("data/beachbugs_long.csv")
beachbugs
```

2. Use `pivot_wider` to transform the data into wide format.
```{r}
beachbugs_wide <- beachbugs %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = site,
              values_from = buglevels)
beachbugs_wide
```

3. Now, use `pivot_longer` to transform them back to long!
```{r}
beachbugs_wide %>% 
  pivot_longer(-year,
               names_to = "site",
               values_to = "buglevels")
```

## Grammar of Graphics
The ability to quickly produce and edit graphs and charts is a strength of R. These data visualizations are produced by the package `ggplot2` and it is a core part of the tidyverse. The syntax for using ggplot is specific and common to all of the plots. This is what Hadley Wickham calls a [Grammar of Graphics](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf). The "gg" in `ggplot` stands for grammar of graphics.

## Philosophy
What makes a good chart? In my opinion a good chart is elegant in its simplicity. It provides a clean, clear visual of the data without being overwhelming to the reader. This can be hard to do and takes some careful thinking. Always keep in mind that the reader will almost never know the data as well as you do so you need to be mindful about presenting the facts.  

## Data Types
We first need to define some of the data types we will use to build plots.  

+ `discrete` quantitative data that only contains integers
+ `continuous` quantitative data that can take any numerical value
+ `categorical` qualitative data that can take on a limited number of values

## Basics
The syntax used by ggplot takes some practice to get used to, especially for customizing plots, but the basic elements are the same. It is helpful to think of plots as being built up in layers.  

In short, **plot= data + geom_ + aesthetics**.  

We start by calling the ggplot function, identifying the data, and specifying the axes. We then add the `geom` type to describe how we want our data represented. Each `geom_` works with specific types of data and R is capable of building plots of single variables, multiple variables, and even maps. Lastly, we add aesthetics.


To make a plot, we need to first specify the data and map the aesthetics. The aesthetics include how each variable in our data set will be used. In the example below, I am using the aes() function to identify the x and y variables in the plot.
```{r}
ggplot(data=iris, #specify the data
       mapping=aes(x=Species, y=Petal.Length)) #map the aesthetics
```

Notice that we have a nice background, labeled axes, and even a value range of our variables on the y-axis- but no plot. This is because we need to tell ggplot how we want our data represented. This is called the geometry or `geom()`. There are many types of `geom`, see the ggplot [cheatsheet](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/).

Here we specify that we want a boxplot, indicated by `geom_boxplot()`.
```{r}
ggplot(data=iris, #specify the data
       mapping=aes(x=Species, y=Petal.Length))+ #map the aesthetics
  geom_boxplot() #add the plot type
```

## Practice
1. Use the iris data to build a scatterplot that compares sepal length vs. sepal width. Use the cheat sheet for help to find the correct `geom_` for a scatterplot.
```{r}
names(iris)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=iris, 
       mapping=aes(x=Sepal.Width, y=Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_point() #scatterplot
```

## Scatterplots and barplots
Now that we have a general idea of the syntax, let's start by working with two common plots: 1) scatter plots and 2) bar plots.

## Data
**Database of vertebrate home range sizes.**  
Reference: Tamburello N, Cote IM, Dulvy NK (2015) Energy and the scaling of animal space use. The American Naturalist 186(2):196-211. http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/682070.  
Data: http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.q5j65/1  
```{r}
homerange <- read_csv("data/Tamburelloetal_HomeRangeDatabase.csv")
```
### 1. Scatter Plots
Scatter plots are good at revealing relationships that are not readily visible in the raw data. For now, we will not add regression aka. "best of fit" lines or calculate any r^2^ values.  

In the case below, we are exploring whether or not there is a relationship between animal mass and home range. We are using the **log transformed values** because there is a large difference in mass and home range among the different species in the data.
```{r}
names(homerange)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=homerange, #specify the data
       mapping=aes(x=log10.mass, y=log10.hra))+ #map the aesthetics
  geom_point() #add the plot type
```

In big data sets with lots of overlapping values, over-plotting can be an issue. `geom_jitter()` is similar to `geom_point()` but it helps with over plotting by adding some random noise to the data and separating some of the individual points.
```{r}
ggplot(data=homerange, mapping=aes(x=log10.mass, y=log10.hra))+
  geom_jitter() #adds some random noise
```

To add a regression (best of fit) line, we just add another layer.
```{r}
ggplot(data=homerange, mapping=aes(x=log10.mass, y=log10.hra))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=T) #add a regression line
```

### Practice
1. What is the relationship between log10.hra and log10.preymass? What do you notice about how ggplot treats NA's?
```{r}
ggplot(data=homerange,
       mapping=aes(x=log10.hra, y=log10.preymass))+
  geom_point(na.rm=T)+
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=T, na.rm=T)
```

### Bar Plot: `geom_bar()`
The simplest type of bar plot counts the number of observations in a categorical variable. In this case, we want to know how many observations are present in the variable `trophic.guild`. Notice that we do not specify a y-axis because it is count by default.  

```{r}
homerange %>% 
  count(trophic.guild)
```

Also notice that we can use pipes! The `mapping=` function is implied by `aes` and so is often left out. 
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(trophic.guild)) + 
  geom_bar() #good for counts
```

### Bar Plot: `geom_col()`
Unlike `geom_bar()`, `geom_col()` allows us to specify an x-axis and a y-axis.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  filter(family=="salmonidae") %>%
  select(common.name, log10.mass) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=common.name, y=log10.mass))+ #notice the switch in x and y
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()
```

`geom_bar()` with `stat="identity"`
`stat="identity"` allows us to map a variable to the y-axis so that we aren't restricted to counts.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  filter(family=="salmonidae") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=common.name, y=log10.mass))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")
```

## Practice
1. Filter the `homerange` data to include `mammals` only.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  filter(class=="mammalia")
```

2. Are there more herbivores or carnivores in mammals? Make a bar plot that shows their relative numbers.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  filter(class=="mammalia") %>% 
  count(trophic.guild)
```
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  filter(class=="mammalia") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=trophic.guild))+
  geom_bar()
```



```{r}
homerange %>% 
  filter(class=="mammalia") %>% 
  count(trophic.guild) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=trophic.guild, y=n))+
  geom_col() #produce the same result
```

3. Make a bar plot that shows the masses of the top 10 smallest mammals.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  filter(class=="mammalia") %>% 
  top_n(-10, log10.mass) %>% #the last 10 number
  ggplot(aes(x=common.name, y=log10.mass))+
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()
```

## Review
Now that you have been introduced to `ggplot`, let's practice a few more plot types. Remember that plots are built in layers: **plot= data + geom_ + aesthetics**. We have to specify each of these in order for a plot to be produced. If you get stuck, it is often helpful to stop and make a quick sketch of what you want or expect to see on a piece of scratch paper.  


Make this output more visual by adding a plot...
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  count(island) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=island, y=n))+
  geom_col()
```

## Practice
1. What if we wanted a plot that showed the number of measured penguins for each species?
```{r}
penguins %>% count(species)
```

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  count(species) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=species, y=n))+
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=species))+
  geom_bar()
```

2. How about average bill length by sex?
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(sex!="NA") %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(ave_bill_length_mean=mean(bill_length_mm)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=sex, y=ave_bill_length_mean))+
  geom_col()
```



## Box Plots for visualization of range of values
For the next series of examples, we will use the `homerange` data.  **Database of vertebrate home range sizes.**   

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
homerange <- read_csv("data/Tamburelloetal_HomeRangeDatabase.csv")
```

Boxplots help us visualize a range of values. So, on the x-axis we typically have something categorical and the y-axis is the range. In the case below, we are plotting `log10.mass` by taxonomic class in the `homerange` data. `geom_boxplot()` is the geom type for a standard box plot. The center line in each box represents the median, not the mean.

Let's look at the variable `log10.mass` grouped by taxonomic class.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarize(min_log10.mass=min(log10.mass),
            max_log10.mass=max(log10.mass),
            median_log10.mass=median(log10.mass))
```

```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = class, y = log10.mass)) + # x is category and y is number
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Practice
1. There are more herbivores than carnivores in the homerange data, but how do their masses compare? Make a summary and boxplot that compares their masses. Use `log10.mass`.
```{r}
names(homerange)
```

```{r}
homerange %>% 
  group_by(trophic.guild) %>% 
  summarize(mean_log10_mass=mean(log10.mass))
```

```{r}
homerange %>% 
  group_by(trophic.guild) %>% 
  summarize(mean_log10_mass=mean(log10.mass)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=trophic.guild, y=mean_log10_mass))+
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=trophic.guild, y=log10.mass))+
  geom_boxplot()
```


2. Have a closer look at carnivorous mammals. Summarize the range of log10.mass by family. use boxplot because it is asking for range
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  filter(trophic.guild=="carnivore" & class=="mammalia") %>% 
  select(family, trophic.guild, log10.mass) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=family, y=log10.mass))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  coord_flip()
```


LAB 11
## Load the libraries
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("janitor")
```

## Load the data
Let's revisit the mammal life history data to practice our ggplot skills. The [data](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E084/093/) are from: *S. K. Morgan Ernest. 2003. Life history characteristics of placental non-volant mammals. Ecology 84:3402.*
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
life_history <- read_csv("data/mammal_lifehistories_v2.csv", na="-999") %>% clean_names()
```

## Bar Plots
Bar plots count the number of observations in a categorical variable. What is the difference between `geom_bar` and `geom_col`? Make two bar plots showing the number of observations for each order using each geom type.

```{r}
names(life_history)
```

`geom_col`
```{r}
life_history %>% 
  count(order, sort=T) %>%   #this is the same as arrange
  ggplot(aes(x=order, y=n))+
  geom_col()+ #geo col is also bar graph
  coord_flip()
```

`geom_bar`
```{r}
life_history %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=order))+
  geom_bar()+
  coord_flip()
```

Remember that ggplot build plots in layers. These layers can significantly improve the appearance of the plot. What if we wanted a bar plot of the mean mass for each order? Would we use `geom_bar` or `geom_col`?  
```{r}
life_history %>% 
  group_by(order) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mass=mean(mass, na.rm=T)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=order, y=mean_mass))+
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()
```

There are a few problems here. First, the y-axis is in scientific notation. We can fix this by adjusting the options for the session.
```{r}
options(scipen=999)#cancels scientific notation for the session
```

Next, the y-axis is not on a log scale. We can fix this by adding `scale_y_log10()`.
```{r}
life_history %>% 
  group_by(order) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mass=mean(mass, na.rm=T)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=order, y=mean_mass))+
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()+
  scale_y_log10()
```

Lastly, we can adjust the x-axis labels to make them more readable. We do this using `reorder`.
```{r}
life_history %>% 
  group_by(order) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mass=mean(mass, na.rm=T)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(order, mean_mass), y=mean_mass))+ #this allows us to order the x axis by mean_mass
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()+
  scale_y_log10()
```

## Scatterplots
Scatter plots allow for comparisons of two continuous variables. Make a scatterplot below that compares gestation time and weaning mass.
```{r}
life_history %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=gestation, y=wean_mass))+
  geom_jitter(na.rm=T)+
  scale_y_log10()
```

## Boxplots
Box plots help us visualize a range of values. So, on the x-axis we typically have something categorical and the y-axis is the range. Let's make a box plot that compares mass across taxonomic orders.
```{r}
life_history %>% 
  filter(order!="Cetacea") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=order, y=mass))+
  geom_boxplot(na.rm=T)+
  coord_flip()
```
## Aesthetics: Labels
Now that we have practiced scatter plots, bar plots, and box plots we need to learn how to adjust their appearance to suit our needs. Let's start with labeling x and y axes.  

```{r}
elephants <- read_csv("data/elephantsMF.csv") %>% clean_names()
```

Make a plot that compares age and height of elephants.
```{r}
elephants %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=age, y=height))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se=F)
```

The plot looks clean, but it is incomplete. A reader unfamiliar with the data might have a difficult time interpreting the labels. To add custom labels, we use the `labs` command.
```{r}
elephants %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=age, y=height)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=F)+
  labs(title="Elephant Age vs. Height", #adds a title
       x="Age (years)",
       y="Height (cm)")
```

We can improve the plot further by adjusting the size and face of the text. We do this using `theme()`. The `rel()` option changes the relative size of the title to keep things consistent. Adding `hjust` allows control of title position.
```{r}
elephants %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=age, y=height)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=T)+
  labs(title="Elephant Age vs. Height", #adds a title
       x="Age (years)",
       y="Height (cm)")+
  theme(plot.title=element_text(size=rel(1.75), hjust = 0.5))
```

## Other Aesthetics
There are lots of options for aesthetics. An aesthetic can be assigned to either numeric or categorical data. `fill` is a common grouping option; notice that an appropriate key is displayed when you use one of these options.
```{r}
elephants %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=sex, fill=sex))+ #fill is a grouping option and give color to each column
  geom_bar()
```

`size` adjusts the size of points relative to a continuous variable.
```{r}
life_history %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=gestation, y=log10(mass), size=mass))+
  geom_point(na.rm=T)
```

## Load the libraries
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## Removes scientific notation
```{r}
options(scipen=999) #cancels the use of scientific notation for the session
```

## Data
**Database of vertebrate home range sizes.**  
Reference: Tamburello N, Cote IM, Dulvy NK (2015) Energy and the scaling of animal space use. The American Naturalist 186(2):196-211. http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/682070.  
Data: http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.q5j65/1  
```{r}
homerange <- 
  read_csv("data/Tamburelloetal_HomeRangeDatabase.csv", na = c("", "NA", "\\"))
```

## A few more useful aesthetics
There are many options to create nice plots in ggplot. One useful trick is to store the plot as a new object and then experiment with geom's and aesthetics. Let's setup a plot that compares `log10.mass` and `log10.hra.` Notice that we are not specifying a geom.
```{r}
p <- homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= log10.mass, y= log10.hra)) #make the plot into a new variable so later if you want to edit it you just use the new variable instead of typing everything again 
```

Play with point size by adjusting the `size` argument.
```{r}
p + geom_point(size=2)
```

We can color the points by a categorical variable.
```{r}
p + geom_point(aes(color=thermoregulation), size=1.5) #for scatterplots, color is the same as fill in barplots
```

We can also map shapes to another categorical variable.
```{r}
p + geom_point(aes(color=thermoregulation, shape=thermoregulation), size=1.5)
```

## Barplots and multiple variables
At this point you should be comfortable building bar plots that show counts of observations using `geom_bar()`. Last time we explored the `fill` option as a way to bring color to the plot; i.e. we filled by the same variable that we were plotting. What happens when we fill by a different categorical variable?  
Let's start by counting how many observations we have in each taxonomic group.
```{r}
homerange %>% count(taxon, sort=T)
```

Now let's make a bar plot of these data.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(taxon))+
  geom_bar()+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(title="Observations by Taxon",
       x="Taxonomic Group")
```

By specifying `fill=trophic.guild` we build a stacked bar plot that shows the proportion of a given taxonomic group that is an herbivore or carnivore.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=taxon, fill=trophic.guild))+
  geom_bar()+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(title="Observations by Taxon",
       x="Taxonomic Group")
```

We can also have counts of each trophic guild within taxonomic group shown side-by-side by specifying `position="dodge"`.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=taxon, fill=trophic.guild))+
  geom_bar(position="dodge")+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(title="Observations by Taxon",
       x="Taxonomic Group")
```

Here is the same plot oriented vertically.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=taxon, fill=trophic.guild))+
  geom_bar(position="dodge")+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=15, hjust = 1))+
  labs(title="Observations by Taxon",
       x="Taxonomic Group")
```

We can also scale all bars to a percentage.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = taxon, fill = trophic.guild))+
  geom_bar(position = position_fill())+ 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  coord_flip()
```

## Practice
For this practice, let's use the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html) data.  

1. Make a bar plot that shows counts of individuals by island. Fill by species, and try both a stacked bar plot and `position="dodge"`.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=island, fill=species))+
  geom_bar()+
  labs(title="Counts of Individuals by Island",
       x="Island",
       fill="Species")
```

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=island, fill=species))+
  geom_bar(position="dodge")+
  labs(title="Counts of Individuals by Island",
       x="Island",
       fill="Species")
```

2. Make another bar plot that shows the number of individuals by sex on each island?
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(sex!="NA") %>% # this removes the NA's
  ggplot(aes(x=island, fill=sex))+
  geom_bar(position="dodge")+
  labs(title="Counts of Individuals by Island",
       x="Island",
       fill="Penguin Species")
```

## Using `group`
In addition to `fill`, `group` is an aesthetic that accomplishes the same function but does not add color.

Here is a box plot that shows `log10.mass` by taxonomic `class.`
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = class, y = log10.mass)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

I use `group` to make individual box plots for each taxon within class.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = class, y = log10.mass, group = taxon)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

I can also use `fill` to associate the different taxa with a color coded key.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = class, y = log10.mass, fill=taxon)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.6)
```

## Review
1. Use the `homerange` data to make a boxplot that shows the range of `log10.mass` by taxonomic class.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=class, y=log10.mass))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

2. Now, add a layer to this plot that fills color for each box by taxonomic class
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=class, y=log10.mass, fill=class))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

3. Use `group` to show the range of `log10.mass` by taxon.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=class, y=log10.mass, group=taxon))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

4. Use `fill` to show the range of `log10.mass` by taxon with color codes.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=class, y=log10.mass, fill=taxon))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Line plots
Line plots are great when you need to show changes over time. Here we look at the number of samples for species DM and DS over the years represented in the `deserts` data. This takes some careful thought- we want to know how sampling has changed over time for these two species.    

Let's start by making a clear x and y so we know what we are going to plot.
```{r}
deserts %>% 
  filter(species_id=="DM" | species_id=="DS") %>% 
  mutate(year=as.factor(year)) %>% 
  group_by(year, species_id) %>% 
  summarize(n=n(), .groups = 'keep') %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = species_id, values_from = n)
```

```{r}
deserts %>% 
  filter(species_id=="DM" | species_id=="DS") %>% 
  mutate(year=as.factor(year)) %>% 
  group_by(year, species_id) %>% 
  summarize(n=n(), .groups = 'keep') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=n, group=species_id, color=species_id))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_point(shape=3)+ #you can experiment with shapes
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60, hjust=1))+
  labs(title="Number of Samples for Species DM & DS",
       x="Year",
       y="n")
```

## Histograms
Histograms are frequently used by biologists; they show the distribution of continuous variables. As students, you have seen histograms of grade distributions. A histogram `bins` the data and you specify the number of bins that encompass a range of observations. For something like grades, this is easy because the number of bins corresponds to the grades A-F. By default, R uses a formula to calculate the number of bins but some adjustment may be required.  

What does the distribution of body mass look like in the `homerange` data?
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log10.mass)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20)+ #we can adjust the number of bins with the bins argument
  labs(title = "Distribution of Body Mass")
```

Let's play with the colors. This shows all 657 of R's built-in colors. Notice that `color` and `fill` do different things!
```{r}
grDevices::colors()
```

Let's rebuild the histogram, but this time we will specify the color and fill. Do a little experimentation on your own with the different colors.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log10.mass)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "violetred4", bins=10)+
  labs(title = "Distribution of Body Mass")
```

## Density plots  
Density plots are similar to histograms but they use a smoothing function to make the distribution more even and clean looking. They do not use bins.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log10.mass)) +
  geom_density(fill="deepskyblue4", alpha  =0.4, color = "black")+ #alpha is the transparency
  labs(title = "Distribution of Body Mass")
```

I like to see both the histogram and the density curve so I often plot them together. Note that I assign the density plot a different color
```{r message=FALSE}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=log10.mass)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), fill = "deepskyblue4", alpha = 0.4, color = "black")+
  geom_density(color = "red")+
  labs(title = "Distribution of Body Mass")
```

## Practice
1. Make a histogram of `log10.hra`. Make sure to add a title.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=log10.hra))+ #only need to specify an x
  geom_histogram(color="black", fill="violetred4", alpha=0.3)+
  labs(title="Distribution of Homerange")
```

2. Now plot the same variable using `geom_density()`.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=log10.hra))+ #only need to specify an x
  geom_density(color="black", fill="violetred4", alpha=0.3)+
  labs(title="Distribution of Homerange")
```

3. Combine them both!
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=log10.hra))+
  geom_histogram(aes(y=after_stat(density)), fill="violetred4", alpha=0.3, color="black")+
  geom_density(color="orange")+
  labs(title="Distribution of Homerange")
```

## Create Categories with mutate and case_when()
`case_when()` is a very handy function from `dplyr` which allows us to calculate a new variable from other variables. We use `case_when()` within `mutate()` to do this.`case_when()` allows us to specify multiple conditions. Let's reclassify the body mass variable into a new factor variable with small, medium, and large animals. In this case, we are making a continuous variable into a categorical variable.  

```{r}
homerange %>% 
  mutate(mass_category=case_when(log10.mass<=1.75 ~ "small",
                                 log10.mass>1.75 & log10.mass<=2.75 ~ "medium",
                                 log10.mass>2.75 ~ "large"))
```


Here we check how the newly created body mass categories compare across `trophic.guild`. 
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  mutate(mass_category=case_when(log10.mass<=1.75 ~ "small",
                                 log10.mass>1.75 & log10.mass<=2.75 ~ "medium",
                                 log10.mass>2.75 ~ "large")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=mass_category, fill=trophic.guild))+
  geom_bar(position="dodge")
```

## Practice
1. Use case_when() to make a new column `range_category` that breaks down `log10.hra` into very small, small, medium, and large classes based on quartile.

```{r}
library(gtools)
install.packages("gtools")
```

```{r}
quartiles <- quantcut(homerange$log10.hra) #finding the quartiles
table(quartiles)
```

```{r}
homerange %>% 
  mutate(range_category=case_when(log10.hra<3.65 ~ "very small",
                                  log10.hra>=3.65 & log10.hra<=4.59 ~ "small",
                                  log10.hra>4.59 & log10.hra<=6.02 ~ "medium",
                                  log10.hra>=6.02 ~ "large"))
```




2. Make a plot that shows how many and which taxonomic classes are represented in each `range_category`.   
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  mutate(range_category=case_when(log10.hra<3.65 ~ "very small",
                                  log10.hra>=3.65 & log10.hra<=4.59 ~ "small",
                                  log10.hra>4.59 & log10.hra<=6.02 ~ "medium",
                                  log10.hra>=6.02 ~ "large")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=range_category, fill=class))+
  geom_bar(position="dodge", alpha=0.6, color="black")
```

3. Isolate the small `range_category` and plot the range of `log10.mass` by taxonomic class.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  mutate(range_category=case_when(log10.hra<3.65 ~ "very small",
                                  log10.hra>=3.65 & log10.hra<=4.59 ~ "small",
                                  log10.hra>4.59 & log10.hra<=6.02 ~ "medium",
                                  log10.hra>=6.02 ~ "large")) %>% 
  filter(range_category=="small") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=class, y=log10.mass, fill=class))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Load the libraries
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(paletteer)
library(janitor)
```

```{r}
options(scipen=999) #cancels the use of scientific notation for the session
```


Let's start by building a simple barplot.  
```{r}
p <- homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=taxon, fill=trophic.guild))+
  geom_bar(na.rm=T, position="dodge")
```

Have a look at the `linedraw` theme; I am adding it as another layer.
```{r}
p + theme_light()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust=1))+
  labs(title = "Observations by Taxon in Homerange Data",
       x = NULL,
       y= "n",
       fill= "Trophic Guild")
```

## Practice
1. Build a scatterplot that compares `log10.mass` and `log10.preymass`. Color the points by `taxon`. Store this plot as object `q`.
```{r}
q <- homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=log10.mass, y=log10.preymass, color=taxon))+
  geom_point(na.rm=T)
```

2. Use plot `q` but add the classic theme.
```{r}
q+theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
p+theme_linedraw()+
  theme(legend.position = "left",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust=1))+
  labs(title = "Observations by Taxon in Homerange Data",
       x = NULL, #removes the label from the x axis
       y= "n",
       fill= "Trophic Guild")
```

## Not enough? Try using `ggthemes`
There are many packages that include additional themes, one of which is [ggthemes](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/). Some of these are nice because they are designed to mimic the look of popular publications.
```{r}
install.packages("ggthemes")
library(ggthemes)
```

Here is a list of the `ggthemes`
```{r}
ls("package:ggthemes")[grepl("theme_", ls("package:ggthemes"))]
```

```{r}
p + 
  theme_few()+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust=1))+
  labs(title = "Observations by Taxon in Homerange Data",
       x = NULL,
       y= "n",
       fill= "Trophic Guild")
```

## Practice
1. Use plot `q` and try the `theme_economist()` theme.
```{r}
p + 
  theme_economist()+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust=0))+
  labs(title = "Observations by Taxon in Homerange Data",
       x = NULL,
       y= "n",
       fill= "Trophic Guild")
```

## RColorBrewer
The default colors used by ggplot are often uninspiring. They don't make plots pop out in presentations or publications, and you may want to use a customized palette to make things visually consistent.  

Access the help for `RColorBrewer`.
```{r}
?RColorBrewer
```

The thing to notice is that there are three different color palettes: 1) sequential, 2) diverging, and 3) qualitative. Within each of these there are several selections. You can bring up the colors by using `display.brewer.pal()`. Specify the number of colors that you want and the palette name.
```{r}
display.brewer.pal(5,"PuBuGn") #sequential palette
```

The [R Color Brewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) website is very helpful for getting an idea of the color palettes. To make things easy, use these two guidelines:

+`scale_colour_brewer()` is for points  
+`scale_fill_brewer()` is for fills  

Here I chose the `Paired` palette. Take a moment and experiment with other options.
```{r}
p+scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PuBuGn")+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust=1))+
  labs(title = "Observations by Taxon in Homerange Data",
       x = NULL,
       y= "n",
       fill= "Trophic Guild")
```

## Practice
1. Keep using the `same `q` plot, but test out one of R Color Brewer palettes.
```{r}
q+scale_colour_brewer(palette = "PuBuGn")
```

## Manually Setting Colors
You can also use `paleteer` to build a custom palette for consistency. To access the `paleteer` collection, I add it to a new object.
```{r}
colors <- paletteer::palettes_d_names
```

Now we can display the palettes. Assign the palette to `my_palette` and then build this base R bar plot. There are a lot of options; `paleteer` is a collection of popular palettes. I really like the [`ggsci` package] (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggsci/vignettes/ggsci.html)
```{r}
my_palette <- paletteer_d("ggsci::nrc_npg") #store your palette
```

```{r}
barplot(rep(1,6), axes=FALSE, col=my_palette) # show your palette
```

Now we just identify `my_palette` as part of `scale_fill_manual()`
```{r}
p+scale_fill_manual(values=my_palette)+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust=1))+
  labs(title = "Observations by Taxon in Homerange Data",
       x = NULL,
       y= "n",
       fill= "Trophic Guild")
```

## Practice
1. Keep using the `same `q` plot, but test out one of `paleteer` themes.
```{r}
q+theme_classic()+scale_colour_manual(values=my_palette)
```

## Faceting
[Faceting](https://ggplot2-book.org/facet.html) is one of the amazing features of ggplot. It allows us to make multi-panel plots for easy comparison.  Here is a boxplot that shows the range of log10.mass by taxon.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=taxon, y=log10.mass))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust=1))
```

There are other categorical variables that might be interesting to overlay. `facet_wrap()` makes a ribbon of panels by a specified categorical variable and allows you to control how you want them arranged.  
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=taxon, y=log10.mass))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_wrap(~trophic.guild)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust=1))
```

`facet_grid()` allows control over the faceted variable; it can be arranged in rows or columns. rows~columns. 
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=taxon, y=log10.mass))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_grid(.~trophic.guild)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust=1))
```

`facet_grid()` will also allow the comparison of two categorical variables, just remember a~b where a is rows and b is columns.  
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=taxon, y=log10.mass))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_grid(trophic.guild~thermoregulation)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust=1))
```
